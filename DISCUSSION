randomness, true randomness, is rare. so rare in fact, that in order to produce sufficient amounts of it, people often opt for hardware extensions (viz HRNGs) to produce it. Up until recently, high quality random bits were not available without such devices and while Intel provides HRNGs on its modern chips, operating system kernels do not provide native support. In fact, MS Windows provides no support whatsoever for it, whereas at least the linux kernel produces it from the (mostly) user generated activities. What linux does produce, however, is scarce, and ... TO BE COMPLETED
